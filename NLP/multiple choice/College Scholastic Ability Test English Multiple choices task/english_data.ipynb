These critics \\nwould listen to them well before the general public could and \\npreview them for the rest of the world in their reviews. Once \\nthe internet made music easily accessible and allowed even \\nadvanced releases to spread through online social networks, \\navailability of new music became democratized, which meant \\ncritics no longer had unique access. That is, critics and \\nlaypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously. Social \\nmedia services also enabled people to publicize their views on \\nnew songs, list their new favorite bands in their social media \\nbios, and argue over new music endlessly on message boards. \\nThe result was that critics now could access the opinions of the \\nmasses on a particular album before writing their reviews. \\nThus, instead of music reviews guiding popular opinion toward \\nart (as they did in preinternet times), music reviews began to \\nreflect ― consciously or subconsciously ― public opinion.', 'Difficulties arise when we do not think of people and \\nmachines as collaborative systems, but assign whatever tasks \\ncan be automated to the machines and leave the rest to people. \\nThis ends up requiring people to behave in machine-like \\nfashion, in ways that differ from human capabilities. We \\nexpect people to monitor machines, which means keeping alert \\nfor long periods, something we are bad at. We require people \\nto do repeated operations with the extreme precision and \\naccuracy required by machines, again something we are not \\ngood at.

Place\\na small ordinary object in his palm ― a ring, an eraser, \\nanything will do ― and ask him to identify it without moving \\nany part of his hand. He won’t have a clue other than weight \\nand maybe overall size. Then tell him to keep his eyes closed \\nand move his fingers over the object. He’ll most likely identify \\nit at once. By allowing the fingers to move, you’ve added time \\nto the sensory perception of touch.

Herbert \\nSimon’s “parable of the ant” makes this point very clearly. \\nImagine an ant walking along a beach, and visualize\\ntracking the trajectory of the ant as it moves. The trajectory \\nwould show a lot of twists and turns, and would be very \\nirregular and complicated. One could then suppose that the ant \\nhad equally complicated internal navigational abilities, \\nand work out what these were likely to be by analyzing the \\ntrajectory to infer the rules and mechanisms that could produce\\nsuch a complex navigational path. The complexity of the \\ntrajectory, however, “is really a complexity in the surface of \\nthe beach, not a complexity in the ant.” In reality, the ant may \\nbe using a set of very complex rules: it is the interaction \\nof these rules with the environment that actually produces the \\ncomplex trajectory, not the ant alone. Put more generally, the \\nparable of the ant illustrates that there is no necessary \\ncorrelation between the complexity of an observed behavior \\nand the complexity of the mechanism that produces it.', 'Dear Mr. Kayne,\\nI am a resident of Cansinghill Apartments, located right \\nnext to the newly opened Vuenna Dog Park.

The \\n“biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis” by Elton suggests that high \\ndiversity increases the competitive environment of communities \\nand makes them more difficult to invade.

Educators began \\nto notice that the pendulum had swung too far to the \\n“hands-on” component of inquiry as they realized that the \\nknowledge was not inherent in the materials themselves, \\nbut in the thought and metacognition about what students had \\ndone in the activity. We now know that “hands-on” is a \\ndangerous phrase when speaking about learning science. The \\nmissing ingredient is the “minds-on” part of the \\ninstructional experience.

This might seem \\nsurprising, for the early cotton masters wanted to keep their \\nmachinery running as long as possible and forced their employees \\nto work very long hours. However, by requiring continuous \\nwork during work hours and ruling out non-work activity, \\nemployers had separated out leisure from work. Some did \\nthis quite explicitly by creating distinct holiday periods, when \\nfactories were shut down, because it was better to do this \\nthan have work promoted by the casual taking of days off. \\n‘Leisure’ as a distinct non-work time, whether in the form of \\nthe holiday, weekend, or evening, was a result of the disciplined \\nand bounded work time created by capitalist production. \\nWorkers then wanted more leisure and leisure time was \\nenlarged by union campaigns, which first started in the cotton \\nindustry, and eventually new laws were passed that limited\\nthe hours of work and gave workers holiday entitlements.\\nLeisure was also the creation of capitalism in another \\nsense, through the commercialization of leisure.

The change from a century before\\nwas enormous. In the eighteenth century, performers and\\nlisteners demanded new music all the time, and “ancient music”\\nincluded anything written more than twenty years earlier. But\\nmusicians and audiences in the early 1900s expected that\\nmost concert music they performed or heard would be at least\\na generation old, and they judged new music by the standards\\nof the classics already enshrined in the repertoire. In essence,\\nconcert halls and opera houses had become museums for\\ndisplaying the musical artworks of the past two hundred years.\\nThe repertoire varied according to the performing medium\\nand from region to region, but the core was largely the same\\nthroughout most of Europe and the Americas, including operas\\nand operatic excerpts from Mozart through Verdi, Wagner, and\\nBizet; orchestral and chamber music from Haydn through the\\nlate Romantics; and keyboard music by J. S. Bach, Haydn,\\nMozart, Beethoven, and prominent nineteenth-century composers.\\nLiving composers increasingly found themselves in competition\\nwith the music of the past. This is the great theme of modern\\nmusic in the classical tradition, especially in the first half of the\\ncentury: in competing with past composers for the attention of\\nperformers and listeners who disregarded the classical\\nmasterworks, living composers sought to secure a place for\\nthemselves by offering something new and distinctive while\\ncontinuing the tradition. They combined individuality and\\ninnovation with emulation of the past, seeking to write music\\nthat would be considered original and worthy of performance\\nalongside the masterworks of earlier times.', 'Rules can be thought of as formal types of game cues.\\nThey tell us the structure of the test, that is, what should be\\naccomplished and how we should accomplish it.

The typical plot of the novel\\nis the protagonist’s quest for authority within, therefore, when\\nthat authority can no longer be discovered outside. By this\\naccounting, there are no objective goals in novels, only the\\nsubjective goal of seeking the law that is necessarily created by\\nthe individual.

She\\nthen has the opportunity to offer some amount of it to her\\npartner. The partner only has two options. He can take what’s\\noffered or ④ refused to take anything. There’s no room for\\nnegotiation; that’s why it’s called the ultimatum game. What\\ntypically happens? Many people offer an equal split to the\\npartner, ⑤ leaving both individuals happy and willing to trust\\neach other in the future.', '“Regularity is the key to mastery, Jean.

Any reasonable person would see that!” \\nIn short, we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified. \\nAs far as we can tell, we are only doing what is right and \\nproper and reasonable. Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that \\nwe might be at fault typically are _ by more powerful self-justifying thoughts: “I don’t mean any harm. \\nI’m just! I’m fair! It’s the others who are wrong!” It is \\nimportant to recognize this nature of the human mind as its \\nnatural state. In other words, humans don’t have to learn \\nself-justifying, self-serving, self-deceptive thinking and \\nbehavior. These patterns are innate in every one of us.', 'At some point, these days, a parent realizes his or her \\nchild is tending left. The parent panics. Will the child be \\nmade fun of?

Because rests are silent, people \\noften misinterpret these empty spaces as unimportant. But, \\nimagine what would happen if a song was made up of only \\nnotes, and no rests. Aside from the fact that the “rests would \\nbe history” (pun intended), there would be a wall of sound \\nwith no reference point or discernible backbone to the music. \\nThis is because the spaces between the sounds provide a \\nbaseline and contrast for the piece, and give music structure \\nand texture.

He got his first job as an assistant librarian in 1937, because he had to support his family after his father’s death. Over the next 15 years he published most of the stories that would win international fame―collected in four volumes.
